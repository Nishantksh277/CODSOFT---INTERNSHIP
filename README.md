Why Data Science?

If you say that Data Science is a skill which offers high packages, I don't agree with it my vision to learn data science is to blend my business and IT skills to get data driven insights and finally I can present my findings and insights with anyone using soft skills. That's why I choose to go with data science and find lot of gems from data treasury. üòä
