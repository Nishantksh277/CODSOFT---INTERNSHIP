## üéØ Project Overview

This file contains a comprehensive **Movie Rating Prediction System** developed as part of **Task 1** for the **CodSoft Data Science Internship**. The project leverages machine learning algorithms to accurately predict movie ratings based on multiple feature variables.

### üîç Key Features
- **Multi-feature Analysis**: Utilizes genre, director, cast, and temporal data
- **Advanced Preprocessing**: Robust data cleaning and feature engineering pipeline
- **Model Flexibility**: Supports both traditional ML and deep learning approaches
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves reliable prediction performance on unseen data

## üé™ Problem Statement

> **Challenge**: Can we predict a movie's success (IMDb rating) before its release using only its metadata?

In the competitive entertainment industry, predicting movie success is crucial for:
- **Production Houses**: Investment decisions and budget allocation
- **Distributors**: Marketing strategy and theater allocation
- **Streaming Platforms**: Content acquisition and recommendation systems
- **Movie Enthusiasts**: Informed viewing choices

## üìä Dataset Insights

Our comprehensive dataset encompasses **thousands of movies** with rich metadata:

| Feature | Description | Type |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Name** | Movie title | Text |
| **Genre** | Movie category/genre | Categorical |
| **Director** | Film director | Categorical |
| **Lead Cast** | Top 3 actors (Actor 1, 2, 3) | Categorical |
| **Year** | Release year | Numerical |
| **Duration** | Runtime in minutes | Numerical |
| **Votes** | Number of IMDb votes | Numerical |
| **Rating** | IMDb rating (Target) | Numerical |

### üßπ Data Engineering Pipeline
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive quality checks and outlier detection
- **Type Conversion**: Systematic conversion of year, duration, and votes to numeric format
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Strategic median imputation for numerical features
- **Feature Encoding**: Label encoding for categorical variables with high cardinality
- **Scaling**: StandardScaler normalization for optimal model performance
